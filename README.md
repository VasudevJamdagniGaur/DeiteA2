# 🧠 Deite A2 – AI Mental Wellness Companion

Deite A2 is a mental wellness companion that replaces traditional therapy with a personalized AI chatbot named Deite. Users can talk to Deite about their emotions, daily experiences, or social interactions — such as asking, “Was I rude to my friend?” or “Did I overreact?” The AI provides honest and empathetic reflections to support emotional clarity.

The app also includes a **Day Reflect** section, where daily conversations are automatically summarized into journal entries. Users can revisit and reflect on any past day — enhancing self-awareness, emotional regulation, and cognitive growth.

Deite is powered by **LLaMA 3**, trained to act as a therapeutic assistant, and deployed using **RunPod pods** for scalable, fast inference.
