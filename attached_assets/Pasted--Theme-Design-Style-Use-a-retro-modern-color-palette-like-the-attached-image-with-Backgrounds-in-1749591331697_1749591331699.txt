 Theme & Design Style
Use a retro-modern color palette like the attached image with:

Backgrounds in soft pastels (teal, cream, peach, mint green)

Accent elements in coral red, mustard yellow, and navy blue

Fonts should be playful but readable, with a vintage but friendly look (similar to "Be Mindful" and "Take help" button styles).

Icons should be flat and outlined, matching those shown in the image.

Maintain rounded corners and soft shadows.

📱 Screens Overview
1. Splash Screen
Display the app name: Deite

Background: Vibrant and colorful stripes/rays (just like the "Load" screen in the image)

Add a center button (with an arrow or "Get Started")

2. Onboarding Screen
Title: "Welcome to Deite"

Show 4 feature cards in a 2x2 grid

Each card includes:

An image (icon/illustration)

Short text like:

“Deite is private and secure”

“Helps you channel your thoughts”

“Your safe mental space”

“Therapy & reflection combined”

Keep card color blocks and fonts in the same style as in the “Home” screen image

3. Authentication Screen
Allow users to Sign In or Create Account

Integrate with Firebase using:

Project ID: deitea2-659f5

Project Number: 974533520189

Web API Key: AIzaSyBxtRJ8NPp0TiqjxFNM7ci5UZnowyQhwVU

Use Firebase Authentication (Email/Password)

4. About You Page
Ask for: Name, Age, Gender

Form style should be card-based or bordered fields in retro UI theme

Save these details to Firestore under user’s UID

5. Dashboard (Main Page)
Top: Title text Blish (bold and standout like “Be Mindful” in your image)

Center: Large circle with today’s date

Left/right arrows to browse previous or future dates

Below: Day Reflect section

If no chat exists: "You haven't written anything today"

If chat exists: preview of that day’s journal/chat

Button below: “Chat with Deite” (styled like the "Book Appointment" button)

🧩 Firebase Details to Implement
Authentication via Firebase Auth

User profile info saved to Firestore collection: users

Fields: name, age, gender, uid

Chat and reflections stored in reflections collection with:

uid, date, content

✨ Bonus Features to Match UI Aesthetic
Add subtle animations (e.g., wiggling brain or bouncing buttons)

Keep button labels playful like “Let’s go!”, “Reflect now”, etc.

Use a similar illustrated style for avatars or therapists
